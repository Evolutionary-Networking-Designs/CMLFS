# General Build Notes for chroot

# To build stage2 clang, the following need to be built first:
# o Kernel headers (required for compiling in general)
# o Musl Libc (built clang will expect it in /lib)
# o Zlib-ng (compression for debug symbols)
# o zstd (optional conpression support)
# o net-bsd-curses (optional terminal support)

# Then elftoolchain to replace GNU's Binutils
# o python -> needs libffi
# o lsb-tools -> python

# Musl libc will now be built with LLVM's scudo hardened allocator
# for "performance and security", as explained by Chimera Linux
# developers. Patches from Chimera Linux are used to replace 
# Musl libc's stock allocator with LLVM's scudo.
#
# Per LLVM.org: The Scudo Hardened Allocator is a user-mode 
# allocator, originally based on LLVM Sanitizersâ€™ CombinedAllocator. 
# It aims at providing additional mitigation against heap based 
# vulnerabilities, while maintaining good performance. 
# Scudo is currently the default allocator in Fuchsia, and in 
# Android since Android 11.
