# Cross-Tools: Backup toolchain
# Backup as root

# An archived cross-tools [tool-chain] will be required to
# build libelf for final system in chroot since clang
# does not have true GNU99 support.

# As root, backup the tool-chain for later use
cd $CMLFS
tar -Jcf crosstools-gcc-$(uname -m).tar.xz cross-tools

# Do not remove cross-tools at this time. It will 
# be used to build /cgnutools and /llvmtools
