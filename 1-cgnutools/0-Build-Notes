# General Build Notes for cgnutools

# Builds for cgnutools assume the following:
# o bash is the shell in use
# o sh is a symbolic link to bash
# o /usr/bin/awk is a symbolic link to gawk
# o /usr/bin/yacc is a symbolic link to bison
#   or a script that executes bison

echo $SHELL
file /bin/sh
file /usr/bin/awk
file /usr/binyacc

# Make sure building cgnutools as cmlfs

whoami

# Make sure PATH is set correctly:

export PATH=/cgnutools/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

# Each package should be unpacked in /mnt/cmlfs/source and change 
# to the unpacked source directory. For example:

cd /mnt/cmlfs/sources
tar xf pkgs/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz
cd foo-1.2.3

# Then patch and compile per instruction

# After the package is installed, change directories and remove
# unpacked source directory unless instructed:

cd ..
rm -rf foo-1.2.3
