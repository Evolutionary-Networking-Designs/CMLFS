# Stage1 - Chroot

# To avoid contamination from host system, the rest of llvmtools
# will be built under chroot.

# The following will be built in this order:

# 1  - Patch - Required if any package source needs patching
# 2  - Findutils - Required when cleaning kernel source
# 3  - diffutils
# 4  - Kernel Headers
# 5  - Perl
# 6  - Texinfo - Requires Perl
# 7  - Python3
# 8  - Choose samurai or ninja - Ninja requires Python
# 9  - CMake - Required to configure LLVM source. Has optional
#              Dependancy on Python and samurai/ninja
# 10 - File - Handy tool for ascertaining file type of a given file
# 11 - bmake - Required to build elftoolchain
# 12 - Optional: tcl, expect, & dejagnu - Used for testing built packages.
# 13 - Optional: Vim & Nano - Handy tool(s) for editing text files

# * elftoolchain was not built as requires another package: libarchive.
# The binary tools (i.e. llvm-ar) will be sufficient until the final
# system musl libc is built and libarchive & elftoolchain are built.
